# Build resources

Place platform-specific icons and additional assets in this directory so Electron Builder can include them during packaging.

- `icon.icns` for macOS
- `icon.ico` for Windows
- `icon.png` (at least 512x512) for Linux/AppImage

If you do not supply custom artwork, Electron Builder falls back to its default icons.
